		<p>
			Here is given a step by step guide for creating characters for the Shadowdark RPG hack I have been developing with friends.
		</p>

		<hr>

		<h3>
			Step 1, Attributes
		</h3>

		<p>
			Determine your ability scores by rolling 3d6, and filling in each ability down the line, starting with Strength, and Ending with Charisma.
			If none of the scores is above 14, you may reroll the whole set.
			Once you have your final scores rolled, you may swap up to two scores.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Step 2, Birth Sign
		</h3>

		<p>
			Determine your birth sign by rolling 1d100 on the Alberlond Zodiac Chart.
			Your sign offers one persistent mechanical effect, as well as a rough guideline for how your characters personality might present itself.
			Further, during the month of your sign (in-game) you will have the option once per day to treat a critical failure as a regular failure, representing the luck each person is bestowed by the stars.
			(Even characters born under the Inanis Siderum may still receive this secondary benefit.)

		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td>01&ndash;08: Fluctus</td>
				<td>25&ndash;32: Arboris</td>
				<td>49&ndash;56: Ignis</td>
				<td>73&ndash;80: Draconis</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td>09&ndash;16: Manus</td>
				<td>33&ndash;40: Serpentis</td>
				<td>57&ndash;64: Luscinia</td>
				<td>81&ndash;88: Pugnator</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td>17&ndash;24: Vitulus</td>
				<td>41&ndash;48: Aprum</td>
				<td>65&ndash;72: Currus</td>
				<td>89&ndash;95: Lupus</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td colspan="4">96&ndash;00: Inanis Siderum</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>
			Detailed explanations of each sign and its effect can be found <a href="zodiac.html">here.</a>
			If you are using a standard Shadowdark Character Sheet, put your Sign in place of Race.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Step 3, Background
		</h3>

		<p>
			Determine your background by rolling 1d20 on the list of backgrounds given in the <a href="https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/products/shadowdark-rpg-quickstart-set" target="_blank"><i>Shadowdark RPG Player Quickstart Guide.</i></a>
			Alternatively, you may roll your background on the Diabolical Backgrounds list in <a href="https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/products/cursed-scroll-zine-vol-1-diablerie-print" target="_blank"><i>Cursed Scroll</i> issue 1</a>, if a folk-horror-tinged background is appropriate.
			Your background offers no defined mechanical benefits, but a suggestion of who your character was before, for you to jump upon when the time comes in-game.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Step 4, Alignment
		</h3>

		<p>
			Roll 1d8 on the following table:
		</p>

		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td>1: True Good</td>
				<td>3: True Chaotic</td>
				<td>5: True Evil</td>
				<td>7: True Lawful</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td>2: Chaotic Good</td>
				<td>4: Chaotic Evil</td>
				<td>6: Lawful Evil</td>
				<td>8: Lawful Good</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<h3>
			Step 5, Class
		</h3>

		<p>
			Select your class from the following list.
			Additional classes may also be available at your referee's discretion/behest.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>FIGHTER. Proud swordsmen and daring archers who excel at defeating foes in direct combat and overcoming simple physical challenges. Fighters do best with high Strength and/or Dexterity scores.</li>
			<li>HUNTER. Survivalists and sharpshooters who stalk the woods as warden or predator. Hunters do best with high Dexterity scores.</li>
			<li>PHILOSOPHER. Scholars learned in the sciences of the desert across the sea, who use their understanding of the material world to produce magic-like effects. Philosophers do best with high Wisdom scores.</li>
			<li>PILGRIM. Faith-bound wanderers who offer aid and/or guidance to others whom they meet as they travel the Perilous Path toward enlightenment. Pilgrims do best with high Wisdom scores.</li>
			<li>THIEF. Cunning tricksters who bend or break ethical customs to achieve their goals. Thieves do best with high Dexterity scores.</li>
			<li>WARLOCK. Dishonest scoundrels who cut deals with diabolic forces in exchange for knowledge and power. Warlocks can excel with any primary attribute.</li>
			<li>WITCH. Wise women and dangerous druids who call upon faerie powers to manipulate this mortal realm. Witches do best with high Charisma scores</li>
			<li>WITCH-KNIGHT. Enchanted warriors who use sorceries to help in the heat of battle. Witch-Knights do best with high Strength or Dexterity, and high Charisma scores.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Details on each class are noted in Appendix A.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Step 6, Starting Gear
		</h3>

		<p>
			Select one weapon which your class is proficient with.
			If your class is proficient with chainmail armor, then you may roll for a 1 in 3 chance of starting with the armor.
			If your class is proficient with leather armor, then you may begin with such.
		</p>

		<p>
			For your additional equipment, roll on 1d6d12 on the Gear table on the back of the <i>Shadowdark RPG Player Quistart Guide.</i>
			You may not reroll duplicate items.
		</p>

		<p>
			For your starting finance, roll 1d6gp, 1d12sp, and 1d20cp.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Step 7, Armor Class
		</h3>

		<p>
			For our custom rules, you will need to determine your Dodge Threshold, Armor Bonus, and Armor Class.
			Your Dodge Threshold is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.
		</p>

		<p>
			If wearing leather armor, add +1 to your Dodge Threshold to determine your Armor Class.
			For Chainmail, add +3.
			For Plate Mail add +5 to your Dodge Threshold, but you no longer add your Dexterity Modifier.
		</p>

		<p>
			Your Armor Bonus is your final Armor Class -10.
		</p>
