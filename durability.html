				House Rules for Weapon and Armor Durability
			</h2>
		</center>

		<p>
			The following rules were developed whilst playing 5th Edition <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i>, though work well in OSR play.
			The intention was to make weapon durability simple enough that it could be tracked easily, and would not ruin fun.
			I find it works to create tension, giving the players both an outlet for spending gold, and an incentive to loot equipment more often.
			Above all, I want my players to view their arms and armor as actual things which their characters are holding, rather than as attacks or defences.

		<h3>
			Durability
		</h3>
		
		<p>
			Although a well-wrought weapon may survive decades in caring hands, poor use will wear a sword thin.
			Each time a 1 is rolled on an attack check, the weapon loses 1 point of durability, manifesting as a -1 modifier on future attack checks.
			When a PC suffers a critical attack, their armor degrades, belying -1 AC.
		</p>

		<p>	
			Equipment will degrade up to -3, but one more foul roll will final break the piece.
			The cost to repare is 25% the equipment's price, per level of degradation.
			Whenever a piece of equipment is taken from a fallen foe, the regeree ought to roll 1d10 to determine the condition:
			1&ndash;4 is normal, 5&ndash;7 is -1, 8&ndash;9 is -2, and 0 is -3.
			Tracking enemy durability in the heat of combat may lead to truer verisimilitude, but is not necessary for game balance.
