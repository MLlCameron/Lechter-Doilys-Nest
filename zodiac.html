		<p>
			The following system was designed as a replacement for the race system in <a href="https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark" target="_blank">Shadowdark RPG</a>.
			I run one of those boring campaigns, where everyone must play as humans, but I didn't want to remove the character creation choice race provided&mdash;So I wrote this set to fulfill the same game function.
			All of the racial abilities from the base game are present here, as well as six or seven more of my own invention.
			I have no idea what use this would be for people playing other games, but I hope you get something from this!
