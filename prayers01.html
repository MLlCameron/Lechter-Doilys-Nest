				Pilgrims' Prayers, Tier I
			</h2>
		</center>

		<p>
			Here is the first step in my reskin/expansion of the cleric class in <a href="https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark" target="_blank">Shadowdark RPG</a>, renamed "The Pilgrim."
			All six of the tier I spells from the base game are represented here, along with six new ones largely adapted from AD&D or Dungeon Crawl Classics.
			The names have been changed to add flavor specific to my setting, though I hope that other referees can take some inspiration to ground cleric prayers within their own fiction.

		<h3>
			The Pilgrims' Prayers
		</h3>
	
		<p>
			Here are given many of the prayers commonly invoked by the Pilgrims who walk the Perilous Path&mdash;in service to the gods, or their own spiritual journey.
			The entries listed are not titles per se, but the words of the prayers as they are to be spoken.
		</p>

		<p>
			Note that when a prayer is written with the phrase "[my god]", the Pilgrim is intended to substitute the name of the god under whom they took the Travellers' Oath.
		</p>

		<a id="abundant">
			<h3>
				ABUNDANT SHALL FLOW THE MILK OF THE EARTH
			</h3>
		</a>

		<p>
			Grasp any non-magical stone, of such proportion that it may be held in a single hand.
			The stone begins to lactate, producing the milk of Ilia.
			Any living creature may drink from the stone, to glean as much sustenance as 1 day's rations would otherwise offer.
			The stone feeds ld4 people before running dry, and once used is forever considered magical, and thereby unuseable for this prayer a second time.
		</p>

		<a id="blessed">
			<h3>
				BLESSED BE THIS DAY
			</h3>
		</a>

		<p>
			Pilgrims are invested with the authority to officiate certain ceremonies, though most folk would prefer to find a proper priest.
			This prayer may only be invoked as a ritual.
			Choose one:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>Atonement</i>. Touch the brow of a willing creature who has earned the enmity of a non-evil aligned deity (or otherwise powerful celestial force).
				The higher-power's opinion of the creature becomes neutral, as you lose some favor with the power in question.
				Note that <b>a)</b> you may only atone creatures in the eyes of powers with whom you are in good standing,
				and <b>b)</b> this may anger other forces who are opposed to the power with whom the creature seeks atonement.
			</li>

			<br>

			<li>
				<i>Burial</i>. You consecrate the ground beneath which a creature is layed to await the Coming Doom, binding their corpse to the watch of a Walhutre statue.
				The corpse cannot become victim to necromancy for so long as the Walhutre statue remains standing.
			</li>

			<br>

			<li>
				<i>Coming of Age</i>. When a person reaches the age of 15 they are considered an adult, and a feast is held in their honor.
				You may act as officiant to confer your blessings upon them, granting them one luck token.
			</li>

			<br>

			<li>
				<i>Coronation</i>. You may officiate a person's adopting of a new noble title.
				When you do so, all creatures who have sworn an oath in service of the noble's position gain one luck token.
			</li>

			<br>

			<li>
				<i>Marriage</i>. You may officiate oaths of familial union given between two people.
				They each gain one luck token.
				(Note that whilst there may be cultural ideals surrounding who is allowed to wed whom and when, the effects of the ceremony are the same regardless of wider context.)
			</li>

			<br>

			<li>
				<i>Naming</i>. Soon after a child is born, the community gathers to bury the placenta in a garden of familial or communal importance, planting a bush or tree atop the organ.
				During this ceremony, the child is given their name.
				You may officiate this ceremony, granting the child one luck token.
			</li>

			<br>

			<li>
				<i>Sentencing</i>. You may confirm the rightiousness of a judge's sentence, granting them and all assenting witnesses each one luck token.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<a id="devotion">
			<h3>
				DEVOTION, BE MY LAMP
			</h3>
		</a>

		<p>
			One object you touch glows with a bright, heatless light; illuminating 30' in each direction for up to one hour of real time.
		</p>

		<a id="faith">
			<h3>
				FAITH, BE MY SHIELD
			</h3>
		</a>

		<p>
			A protective force wrought of your holy conviction surrounds you.
			You gain a +1 bonus to your armor class for 5 rounds.
		</p>

		<a id="for">
			<h3>
				FOR I SHALL SEE THE WICKED BY THEIR BREATH
			</h3>
		</a>

		<p>
			You are able to sense emanations of evil for so long as you maintain concentration.
			The prayer's area of perception extends 30'.
		</p>

		<a id="evil">
			<h3>
				LET NO EVIL PIERCE US
			</h3>
		</a>

		<p>
			You touch one willing creature, guarding them against the forces of Pandemonium for so long as you maintain concentration.
			Through this prayer, evil beings have disadvantage on attacks and hostile spellcasting checks made against the warded character.
			Furthermore, evil beings cannot possess, compel, or beguile them.
			When this prayer is invoked on an already possessed creature, the possessing entity, should it be evil, must make a Charisma save against the prayer's spellcasting check, being exorcised on a failure.
		</p>

		<a id="wind">
			<h3>
				LET NO WINDS BREAK US
			</h3>
		</a>

		<p>
			You touch one willing creature, guarding them against the elements, for so long as you are able to maintain concentration.
			Through this prayer, the warded creature is immune to the effects of extreme weather with natural cause, and has advantage on saving checks made against the effects of super-natural heat or cold.
		</p>

		<a id="pure">
			<h3>
				PURE SHALL BE THE PATH  OF THE RIGHTEOUS
			</h3>
		</a>

		<p>
			Energy of life issues forth from your holy symbol, distressing all undead creatures within sight.
			Undead creatures of 9 HD or less must make a Charisma saving check against your spellcasting check.
			On a failure they flee from you for 5 rounds, and cannot willingly enter or end their turn within 30' of you.
			Any creature who fails by 10 or more is isntantly destroyed!
		</p>

		<a id="tremble">
			<h3>
				TREMBLE BEFORE [MY GOD]
			</h3>
		</a>

		<p>
			You may touch one creature, briefly dooming their actions.
			The next two times they roll a d20, roll a d4 and subtract the result from their roll.
			(Note that the d4 is subtracted from the roll, not just the result.
			Hence, a roll of 20 on the d20 can never count as a critical success as it will be read as 16&ndash;9, and the margin of critical failure on the d20 extends to 2&ndash;5.)
		</p>

		<a id="warm">
			<h3>
				WARM THIS AGING FLESH
			</h3>
		</a>

		<p>
			Your holy symbol burns with the flame of the kiln of life, healing one creature you touch with it.
			Roll a number of d6s equal to 1+ half your level rounded down:
			The prayer's recipient regains HP equal to the result.
		</p>

		<a id="grant">
			<h3>
				[MY GOD], GRANT US YOUR STRENGTH
			</h3>
		</a>

		<p>
			You touch one weapon to bless it, giving it +1 to attack and damage for 5 rounds.
		</p>

		<a id="make">
			<h3>
				[MY GOD], MAKE ME YOUR TEMPLE
			</h3>
		</a>

		<p>
			Your holy mission becomes a shroud against mortal conflict.
			For up to 15 minutes real time, all creatures must make a Charisma check against your Wisdom score before targeting you with any hostile action.
			The effects of this prayer terminate if you take any hostile action against another creature.
