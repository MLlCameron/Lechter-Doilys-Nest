		<p>
			Here is a general overview of the Gods in my campeign setting.
			I find a lot of pantheons in rpg settings to feel rather flat, where the different gods are given as a list of names and functions, lacking character.
			My goal here was to write of a cast of mythic beings that not only fulfilled the function of giving clerics gods to worship, but also captured some of the weirdness found in books like <i>The Metamorphoses</i> and <i>The Poetic Edda</i>.
			For many of these characters I have dreamt up longer myths which I hope to share here in the future, but for now this list should be all one needs to bring these characters into their game.
	
			<br>
			<br>

			Anyone is free to use these characters however they wish in their game.
			Adopt the whole pantheon, take a god or two.
			Even if nothing here suits you directly, I hope you find at least some inspiration here for writing your own mythology!
		</p>

		<h3>
			Anomon (Lawful-Good)
		</h3>

		<p>
			The god of reason and justice, of duty, of authority. 
			When Anomon raises his left hand, all that he proclaims becomes.
			Second-born of the Cosmos, Anomon is the highest god, and it is through his spirit that civilizatiom has come to be.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Ilia (Chaotic-Good)
		</h3>

		<p>
			The first-born of the Cosmos, and wife to Anomon.
			The earth itself is Ilia's body, and all physical forms are her domain.
			Ilia is the goddess of sensation, and is found not in the minds of the people, but in their bodies.
			Ilia is not worshipped in churches, but in gardens.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Moina (True Lawful)
		</h3>

		<p>
			Also called the widdow, Moina is the goddess of wisdom, patience, and duty.
			As a child she was taken by Anomon to be Ilia's council, tempering the goddess's wild nature, but she left to watch over the realm of the dead after her husband was poisoned by the witch Livida.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Imbros (True Evil)
		</h3>

		<p>
			The first child of Anomon and Ilia.
			Once a great and honorable warrior, Imbros was poisoned by the witch Livida on the day of his wedding with Moina.
			Imbros returned from death, and, though he was just as handsome as before, his mind was altered, making him a selfish and prideful creature.
			Now husband to Livida, Imbros spends his time drinking and boasting of his former glory.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Amora (True Good)
		</h3>

		<p>
			The goddess of passion, of love and war.
			Born to Anomon and Ilia along with her twin brother Fafros, Amora is now the most powerful warrior and guardian of the heavans.
			Amora often travels far from her family in campeigns of war against the elemental titans, and on such journeys she is known to write long songs and take many lovers, to abate her excitement between battles.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Fafros (True Good)
		</h3>

		<p>
			The god of toil and craftsmanship.
			Both smith and sculptor, Fafros is the architect of the halls of the gods, carpenter of their finest furnature, and goldsmith of their idols, but the most effort is put by him into arms and armor for his twin sister Amora.
			Fafros is a stoic and solitary character, who prefers to speak to others through his works.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Rowos (Lawful-Good)
		</h3>

		<p>
			The son of Moina and the titan Nemos.
			Moina, who regretted her night with Nemos, was a distant mother to the boy, and he was raised by his father on the earth.
			Rowos was the first to teach humans to farm, and he is most often worshipped by pastoral laborers today.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Vola (chaotic-Good)
		</h3>

		<p>
			The goddess of wishes and fancies.
			The daughter of Fafros and Amora, Vola was born in Livida's cursed wode, and was doomed to die if she ever set foot outside that dark place.
			To save Vola from this fate, Anomon brought her spirit into the realm of dreams, whre she now lives free.
			It is said that all tears come first from Vola's eyes.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Simos (True Chaotic)
		</h3>

		<p>
			The son of Amora and the mortal hero Antaeus.
			As he matured, Simos' girlish beauty shined so bright that to see him was to desire him&mdash;but he wanted no lover for himself, and was drivin to hide from those who chased after him.
			Now Simos is a huntsman who lives in a secluded wood, where he has befriended many animals, including wise wolf.
			Simos is not often worshipped, but is sometimes called the god of purity and innocence.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Nemos (True Good)
		</h3>

		<p>
			One of the titans who is friendly with the gods.
			After Imbros was poisoned, Nemos thought to woo Moina, and so he carved a man and woman from wood as gifts, and gave them life in his mother's kiln.
			Moina spent the night with him, but left the next day.
			Nemos raised the boy Rowos, and also tought Fafros fine carving.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Timor (Lawful-Evil)
		</h3>

		<p>
			One of the titans of the earth.
			After the rule of the gods was established, Timor vowed to watch over the souls of the dead in exchange for all the wealth beneath the ground.
			The titan kept his word with pride, until his wife Libeta drove him to madness.
			Now Timor lives in a state of abject fear, while Moina tends to his old responsibilities.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Libeta  (Chaotic-Evil)
		</h3>

		<p>
			The daughter of Imbros and Livida, a vain and lustful creature who has chased pleasure to the destruction of her psyche.
			Once beautiful, Libeta is now like a zombie, numb to any real delight, but indulging still out of a sense of lost habbit.
			The husband of Libeta is the titan Timor.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Livida (Lawful-Evil)
		</h3>

		<p>
			A cruel witch, sometimes called the goddess of envy.
			Livida is not loved by the other gods, but by her marriage to Imbros she is family, and so still welcome in their halls.
			On occasien she will act their ally&mdash;as when she was midwife for Amora during Vola's birth&mdash;but her crime of poisoning Imbros is never forgiven.
			Livida detests her husband Imbros as she made him, as well as her daughter Libeta.
		</p>

		<hr>

		<p>
			Little is known of the rulers of Pandemonium, but for by those who pray to them under the veil of night. The most feared are:
		</p>

		<h3>
			Orcus (Chaotic-Evil)
		</h3>

		<p>
			The half-boar, who comands legions of barbaric demons. Many of his most feared warriors are trapped now on earth, seeking a means back to Pandemonium. They are called Orcs.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Mephistopheles (Lawful-Evil)
		</h3>

		<p>
			A goat with seven horns, the progenator of all dark magics. Those seeking knowledge and power through warlock pacts will bargan with Mephistopheles.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Dis Mater (True Evil)
		</h3>

		<p>
			A great cow and the mother of all demons. She lies like a corps in the centre of Pandemonium, where it is said that she gives birth to 99 demons each day.
